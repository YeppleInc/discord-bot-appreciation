# Discord Appreciation Bot

This is a Discord bot designed to encourage team member satisfaction, communications, and engagement. This bot facilitates two key features in your Discord server:
1) A weekly "Gold Star" poll that allows channel members to vote for teammates who provided significant contributions during the last week. Once votes have been submitted the admin has the ability to close the poll and the bot will automatically tally the votes and display the winner, runners up, as well as comments provided.
2) The ability to allocate "Kudos Dollars" to channel members for going above and beyond in their work. Dollar allocations begin at $100 and can be awarded in increments of $5. The server admin has the ability to reset the allocations to begin a new period (suggested quarterly). 

## Features

- Send kudos to colleagues
- View kudos received
- Check remaining kudos allocations
- Reset kudos allocations
- Start and manage Gold Star polls

## Commands

### `/my_allocations`
**Description:** Check your remaining kudos allocations.

### `/close_poll`
**Description:** Close the Gold Star poll and announce the results.

**Usage:** 
/close_poll

## How It Works

1. **Database Setup:**
   - The bot uses SQLite databases (`kudos.db` and `polls.db`) to store kudos records, user allocations, and poll statuses.

2. **Kudos Management:**
   - Users can send kudos to colleagues and check their remaining allocations. Each user starts with a $100 allocation which can be spent on kudos.

3. **Poll Management:**
   - A Gold Star poll can be initiated and closed by any user. Votes are collected anonymously, and each user can only vote once per poll.

4. **Comments:**
   - When sending kudos or voting, users add comments that will be stored and displayed in results.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install discord.py sqlite3 apscheduler py-cord
```
4. Create an environmental file (.env) with your Discord bot API, such as:
```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=
```
4. Replace the two variables inside of bot.py with your channel ID and your admin member ID.
5. Create a system service that starts/restarts the bot automatically (modify directory paths or user as necessary):
```
[Unit]
Description=Discord Appreciation Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
User=admin
WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/git/discord-bot-appreciation
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/admin/git/discord-bot-appreciation/bot.py
Restart=always
EnvironmentFile=/home/admin/git/discord-bot-appreciation/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
5. Enable and start the bot:
```
systemctl enable discord-appreciation-bot.service
systemctl start discord-appreciation-bot.service
```
